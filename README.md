# GlobalMart-Sales-Perfomance-Analysis
This is a Global Mart Sales performance analysis project.

This analysis evaluates Global Mart’s sales performance across products, customers, and geographical locations to uncover key revenue drivers, profitability gaps, and strategic growth opportunities. Using a cleaned and enriched dataset of 991 records, the study explores how sales, profit margins, discounts, shipping times, and customer segments interact to influence overall business performance.

Key Insights

Category Performance:
Office Supplies lead with $174.93K in sales and a 64.09% profit margin. Technology and Furniture follow closely, showing balanced performance across the product portfolio.

Sub-Category Performance:
Pens are the highest-performing sub-category, generating $70.25K in revenue with a 64.89% margin. Overall profitability across sub-categories ranges between 61% and 65%, showing healthy consistency.

State Performance:
Ohio is the most profitable state with a 69.02% margin, despite moderate revenue. Pennsylvania generates the highest sales ($69.67K) but shows lower profitability (61.35%), suggesting discounting or higher costs.

Seasonality:
Q2 and Q3 are peak seasons, with July achieving the highest average monthly sales. Sales accelerate sharply between May and August across most product categories.

Data Variability:
Sales and profit values show high variance, including a few negative profit transactions, highlighting inconsistent transaction-level performance.

Recommendations

Optimize State-Level Pricing:
Review Pennsylvania’s discounting structure and explore pricing models to reduce profit erosion and align revenue with healthy margins.

Boost High-Performing Products:
Strengthen promotions for high-margin sub-categories such as Pens, Chairs, and Accessories to capture additional growth.

Introduce Cross-Selling Bundles:
Combine top-performing and underperforming products (e.g., Pens + Binders, Chairs + Tables) to balance performance across the portfolio.

Leverage Seasonal Demand:
Increase inventory and targeted marketing ahead of Q2 and Q3 to maximize returns during peak months.

This structured approach provides a clear roadmap for improving revenue quality, strengthening profitability, and driving strategic growth.
